# rust-workshop-2
Dioxus Workhop April 2024

## steps
- [ ] Setup: Dioxus full stack hello world (e.g. https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus/tree/master/packages/fullstack/examples/axum-hello-world/src)
- [ ] UI: RSX components & DaisyUI
- [ ] WASM: Building and distributing wasm over the web
- [ ] OAauth (e.g. https://github.com/randommm/rust-axum-with-google-oauth)

## workshop goal for each participant
- You will build a full stack app that provides some form of web accessible content, but behind an Oauth Provider. Could be something as simple as your CV or as ambitious as a browser game.
- Can be deployed on (??)
- You can bring your already existing Rust project
- -> You get an email list of all your visitors!
